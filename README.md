Hello 👋,

This is a GPS tracking code created using Sim808 and Arduino. When the word "Konum" is sent to the specified phone number 📱, it sends the current location 🌍 via Google Maps to that number. The code has been modified with the TechnicalCareer channel's code 🖥️ and the DFRobot library 📚 (thanks for your efforts 🙏).
